The Persian word sīmurğ (سیمرغ) derives from Middle Persian sēnmurw(and earlier sēnmuruγ), also attested in Pazend texts as sīna-mrū. The Middle Persian word comes from Avestan mərəγō Saēnō "the bird Saēna", originally a raptor, likely an eagle, falcon, or sparrowhawk, as can be deduced from the etymological cognate Sanskrit śyenaḥ (श्येनः) "raptor, eagle, bird of prey", which also appears as a divine figure.Saēna is also a personal name. The word was lent to Armenian as siramarg (սիրամարգ) 'peacock'.[citation needed]
On the other hand, the phrase sī murğ (سی مرغ) means "thirty birds" in Persian; this has been used by Attar of Nishapur in his symbolic story of The Conference of the Birds, the frame story of which employs a play on the name.
